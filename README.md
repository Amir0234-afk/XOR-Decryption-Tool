# XOR Decryption Tool

A Python-based tool for decrypting XOR-encrypted messages. This tool uses a provided Base64-encoded ciphertext and a partial known plaintext to derive the XOR key and decrypt the remaining ciphertext.

## Features
- Decodes Base64-encoded ciphertext to hexadecimal.
- Derives the XOR key from a known plaintext snippet.
- Decrypts the ciphertext using the XOR key.
- Outputs the full decrypted message.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xor-decryption-tool.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd xor-decryption-tool
### Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python xor_decryption_tool.py
2. Provide the required inputs:
   - Base64-encoded ciphertext.
   - Partial known plaintext.
3. View the decrypted message output.
   
### Example
```less
Enter the Base64-encoded ciphertext: [Your Base64 string here]
Enter the ASCII incomplete plaintext: [Known plaintext snippet here]

Decrypted message:
[Decrypted result here]
```
