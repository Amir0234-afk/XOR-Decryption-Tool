# XOR Decryption Tool

A Python-based tool for decrypting XOR-encrypted messages. This tool uses a provided Base64-encoded ciphertext and a partial known plaintext to derive the XOR key and decrypt the remaining ciphertext.

## Features
- Decodes Base64-encoded ciphertext to hexadecimal.
- Derives the XOR key from a known plaintext snippet.
- Decrypts the ciphertext using the XOR key.
- Outputs the full decrypted message.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xor-decryption-tool.git
